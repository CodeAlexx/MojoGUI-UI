# 🔒 BACKUP STATUS - WORKING SYSTEM PRESERVED

## ✅ WORKING SYSTEM BACKED UP

### **Files Backed Up:**
- `c_src_backup_working/` - Complete working C rendering library
- `delphi_ide_demo_working_backup.mojo` - Working IDE demo
- `complete_widget_showcase_working_backup.mojo` - Working showcase

### **Current Working State:**
- ✅ GUI rendering functional
- ✅ All 10 widget types working
- ✅ Professional font loading (Liberation Sans)
- ✅ Split tabs with tooltips working
- ✅ Interactive demos functional

### **Font Investigation Status:**
- 🔍 User correctly noticed fonts might still be bitmap rectangles
- 📝 Need to verify if TTF rendering is actually working vs fallback
- ⚠️  Must preserve working rendering while investigating

### **Recovery Instructions:**
If rendering breaks during font investigation:
```bash
cp -r c_src_backup_working/* c_src/
gcc -shared -fPIC -O3 -o c_src/librendering_with_fonts.so c_src/rendering_with_fonts.c -lglfw -lGL -lm
```

## 🛡️ SAFETY FIRST
Working system preserved before any changes!
